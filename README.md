Download the zip file for Blynk library and copy all the files into the sketchbook location. Firstly install “Blynk” application from play-store and open it. Click on New Project, enter the Project Name, Choose Device as “NodeMCU“, Connection Type as “Wi-Fi” and then click “Create” icon. After the creation of Project, App will send the Auth Token code to registered Email ID. Create a new button, enter the button name and select the GPIO pins (exmaple: D0, D1, D2, D3).
